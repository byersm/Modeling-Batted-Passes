# Intro

-   Exploring the factors that go into causing batted passes
    -   Batted pass: defender hits the ball down shortly after QB releases it
    -   Typically results in incomplete pass, no yards gained
-   Initial characters
    -   QB height
    -   Offensive formation
    -   Defense formation
    -   Pass type
    -   Overall related more to defense or offense

# Data

-   Data from nflreadr
    -   Play by play data 2016 through 2023
